# Validating Dagster definitions

In this guide, we'll walk you through How to validate that your Dagster definitions are loadable using the `dagster definitions validate` command.

**Looking for installation help?** Refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install).

## Understanding the dagster definitions validate command

The `dagster definitions validate` command loads and validate your Dagster definitions using a [Dagster instance](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/dagster-instance).

This command indicates which code locations contain errors, and which ones can be successfully loaded. Code locations containing errors are considered invalid, otherwise valid.

This command returns an exit code 1 when errors are found, otherwise an exit code 0.

This command should be run in a Python environment where the `dagster` package is installed.

## Locating your code

Before validating your Dagster definitions, you need to tell Dagster how to find the Python code containing your assets and jobs. There are a few ways to do this, which are outlined in the tabs below.

**Note**: If using an example Dagster project, or if you used the [`dagster` CLI to create a project](/getting-started/create-new-project#step-1-bootstrap-a-new-project), you can run the `dagster definitions validate` command in the same folder as the project to validate the project code.

<TabItem name="From a file">

Dagster can load a file directly as a code location to validate its definitions. In the following example, we used the `-f` argument to supply the name of the file:

```shell
dagster definitions validate -f my_file.py
```

This command validates the definitions in `my_file.py`.

You can also include multiple files at a time, where the definitions included in each file will be validated:

```shell
dagster definitions validate -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="From a module">

Dagster can also load Python modules as [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) to validate its definitions. When this approach is used, Dagster loads and validate the definitions defined in the module passed to the command line.

We recommend defining a variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in a submodule named `definitions` inside the Python module. In practice, the submodule can be created by adding a file named `definitions.py` at the root level of the Python module.

In the following example, we used the `-m` argument to supply the name of the module and where to find the definitions:

```shell
dagster definitions validate -m your_module_name.definitions
```

This command loads and validate the definitions in the variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in the `definitions` submodule in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple modules at a time, where the definitions included in each module will be validated:

```shell
dagster definitons validate -m your_module_name.definitions -m your_second_module.definitions
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Without command line arguments">

To load and validate definitions without supplying command line arguments, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file. This file, included in all Dagster example projects, contains a `tool.dagster` section with a `module_name` variable:

```toml
[tool.dagster]
module_name = "your_module_name.definitions"  ## name of project's Python module and where to find the definitions
```

When defined, you can run this in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file:

```shell
dagster definitions validate
```

Instead of this:

```shell
dagster definitions validate -m your_module_name.definitions
```

You can also include multiple modules at a time using the `pyproject.toml` file, where the definitions included in each module will be validated:

```toml
[tool.dagster]
modules = [{ type = "module", name = "foo" }, { type = "module", name = "bar" }]
```
